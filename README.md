# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
Project was designed to get familiar using API's and building on top of existing Python knowledge. Using OpenWeathMaps, I retrieved city weather data and created a csv file to save the dataframe. From there, I used Google Maps API to plot all hotels from every city in the csv file created. Lastly, I created an hypothetical itineray from the list of cities in Australia.


### Will update README in the futre
